# Exploring Relationship of cGPA with All Explanatory Variables

Initial exploratory data analysis is being conducted by through basic charts in order to get a better understanding of all of the existing data, in order to see the distribution of the data. This is being done as an altnernative to generating summary tables of the existing data, due to the variance of data types accross columns. The relationship of each of the variables with the cGPA are explored below.
